## How to use GitHub?
### Beginnings
First, you need to get a repository to work on. You can do it in two ways:
-creating new repository

you can do it using 'git init'

```
git init <repository_name>

```
-using already existing repository
To do that, you need to clone desired repoitory.

```
git clone <repository_url>

```
This command will let you download the code to your computer.

**Congratulaions, you created your first repository!**
